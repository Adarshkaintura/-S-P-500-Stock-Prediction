# S&P 500 Stock Prediction

This project leverages machine learning models to predict stock movements in the S&P 500 index. The model predicts whether the stock price will go high or low based on historical data from Yahoo Finance. The user can input a future date, and the app will predict the trend for that date while visualizing the historical stock data up to the selected date.
