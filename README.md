# S&P 500 Stock Prediction

This project leverages machine learning models to predict stock movements in the S&P 500 index. The model predicts whether the stock price will go high or low based on historical data from Yahoo Finance. The user can input a future date, and the app will predict the trend for that date while visualizing the historical stock data up to the selected date.

## What is the S&P 500?

The **S&P 500** (Standard & Poor's 500) is a stock market index that tracks the performance of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices and is considered a benchmark for the overall U.S. stock market's performance. The companies included in the S&P 500 are selected based on factors such as market capitalization, liquidity, and industry representation.

### Key Points:
- **Market Representation**: The S&P 500 represents approximately 80% of the total market value of all U.S. stocks. It covers a broad spectrum of industries, making it a useful indicator of the U.S. economy's health.
- **Market Capitalization**: The companies in the S&P 500 index are large-cap stocks, meaning they have a market value of over $10 billion.
- **Diverse Sectors**: The index includes companies from various sectors like technology, healthcare, financials, consumer goods, energy, and more.
- **Investment**: Many investors use the S&P 500 as a reference for the overall market performance and invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index, such as SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).
- **Historical Performance**: The S&P 500 is often used to measure the performance of the U.S. stock market, with its returns reflecting the health of the broader economy.

In this project, we use the S&P 500 index data to analyze stock movements and make predictions about future trends based on historical performance.
